<h2>Completeness</h2>
<br>
Completeness is a concept we normally associate with, say, wavelets 
rather than with rank
features. An image
representation
is complete if it encodes enough information to allow one to
reconstruct
the original image.<br>
<br>
Clearly, <em>reconstruction is not
possible in the case of rank features</em>,
since the pixel intensity values are discarded after the
ranking, and only rank information is preserved.
However, we can redefine our notion of completeness as follows:<br>
<br>
<b>Definition: <em>A set of rank features is complete if
knowledge of the features uniquely specifies the ranking of the pixels
in the original image.</em></b><br>
<br>
Note that this requirement is<br>
<ul>
  <li><em>maximal:</em> the ranking of the original
image is all the information
than rank features can possibly encode;</li>
  <li><em>non-trivial:</em>
rank features are normally computed by sorting <em>local</em> image 
neighbouhoods, and it
is in general not clear how the local rankings combine to allow
comparisons between the intensity of distant pixels.</li>
</ul>

 alt="A complete set of ranklets in 1 dimension" src="oned.jpg">It can
be proved that <b><em>ranklets
constitute a complete set
of rank features.</em></b><br>
<br>
The image to the left represents a <em>complete set</em>
of ranklets for a
one-dimensional, eight-pixel image. The notation is in analogy with
Haar wavelets: the upper part of each step represents the <b>T</b> set, 
with the lower part corresponding to the <b>C</b> set. The dashed line 
indicates <em>"infinity padding"</em>, in which we deal
with the border conditions by assuming that the missing pixels have an
infinite value.<br>

dimensions can be found in this <a target="_blank"
